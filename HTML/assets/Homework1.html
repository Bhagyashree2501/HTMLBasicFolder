        <center><h1><u>ALGRBRIC EXPRESSIONS AND IDENTITIES</u></h1></center>
        <h3>What are Expressions?</u></h3>
        <p>In earlier classes, we have already become familier with what algebric expressions (or simply expressions) are. Examples of expressions are:<br><blockquote> x+3, 2y-5, 3x<sup>2</sup>, 4xy+7 etc.</blockquote></br>
        </p>
        <p>You can form many more expressions. As you know expressions are formed from variables and constants. The expression 2y-5 is formed from the variable y and constants 2 and 5. The expression 4xy + 7 is formed from variables x and y and constants 4 and 7.
        </p>
        <p> 
            We know that, the value of y in the expression, 2y-5, may be anything.It can be
            2, 5, -3, 0, 5/2, -7/3 etc.; actually countless different values. The value of an expression
            changes with the value chosen for the variables it contains. Thus as y takes on different
            values, the value of 2y-5 goes on changing. When y=2, 2y-5 = 2(2)-5 =-1; when
            y=0, 2y-5 = 2*0-5 =-5, etc. Find the value of the expression 2y-5 for the other given values of y.
        </p>
        <h3>Number line and an expression:</h3>
        <p>Consider the expression x + 5. Let us say the variable x has a position X on the number line;
            X may be anywhere on the number line, but it is definite that the value of x + 5 is given by
            a point P, 5 units to the right of X. Similarly, the value of x-4 will be 4 units to the left of
            X and so on.
            What about the position of 4x and 4x + 5?
            The position of 4x will be point C; the distance of C from the origin will be four times
            the distance of X from the origin. The position D of 4x + 5 will be 5 units to the right of C.</p>
        <h3>TRY THIS</h3>    
        <p>1. Give five examples of expressions containing one variable and five examples of
            expressions containing two variables.
            <br>2. Show on the number line x, x-4, 2x + 1, 3x-2.</br></p>
